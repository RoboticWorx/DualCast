# DualCast
Everything needed to build my DualCast project! DualCast is a LoRa (long-range) transceiver and 2.4GHz wireless network analyzer based on STM32, SX1262, and ESP32-C6.

The all-inclusive, open-source article explaining the project [can be found here for free](https://roboticworx.io/blogs/projects/dualcast).
